2022-08-20,The Devil All the Time,2020,https://boxd.it/39iPPv,1,,"I watch a lot of movies and it's seldom I turn them off, but I did with this one. Just halfway through when Robert Pattinson's wanted a girl to strip in his car for God's sake. Now I'm an devoted atheist, but even for me this was made in poor taste. It makes the Christians seem so unnecessarily evil. It's also so brutal and depressing for no good reason. During this watch, I just realized how boring it is to watch violence when there is no ""reason"" for it, no goals, just misery. And the way all their parents got killed off seemed contrived, especially the last one. I can handle a lot of violence and gore and a nilistic plot, but I feel a movie needs to earn that stuff, and this certaintly did not. Fine actors though. ",,
2023-02-07,Babylon,2022,https://boxd.it/3P93TJ,3.5,,"I prefer LaLaLand... but! There were so many great moments in this movie that made it memorable. I adore the film-making-sequence where the main guy is rushing to collect a camera before the sun sets and all the chaos that ensues. It was soooo over the top and so magical. That sequence alone is worth the watch. The music is catchy, the cinematography is film-like, as if it's drawing upon old cinema, and Brad Pitt is just getting better. All of it together makes for a great ride. I didn't really care for the plot with Dracula-Tobey. Though I love the actor, it just felt random and unnecessary. The reason I'm not giving it a four or five stars is because I think it is a bit of a lacklustre. It's weird, because I love almost every scene individually, but strung together it doesn't do it for me. How Margot Robbie's character ended was a bit underwhelming, and the Cinema Paradiso ending... I want to say it was forced in and a bit unearned... But  actually it works for me. In fact I think I love it. The main guy has a really nice arc from adoring filmmaking to conquering it to having to leave it all behind. Then he returns to the cinema and it's just a really beautiful moment.

Tldr: Every scene by it self is great, but I just didn't care much for the story as a whole.",,2022-12-12
2024-03-04,Dune: Part Two,2024,https://boxd.it/5Y9pMx,5,,"Dune: Part One set the stage and Part Two delivered!

This was such a great watch. I can't remember watching something this epic in cinema, and I have no difficulty in saying this will be the best film of 2024. It starts out surprisingly light-hearted and is quite funny at moments. This ""relatively"" calm start is much needed after the first one... and also within this film considering where it goes. Lots of great performances, but my favorite had to be Javier Bardem as Stilgar. He managed to portray a fanatic religious follower, a funny guy, and a leader all at the same time. I'm so glad that Paul didn't have to challenge and kill him to take his spot at the southern meeting. And from that scene on,  where Paul claims his messiah prophecy, I was sweating in my seat scene after scene until the movie ended! It was an intense and immersive experience that had me cheering for Paul like I was Stilgar. It's a satisfying climax that pays off all the set-up from the first one, and in all the stuff that happens in this movie it even manages to foreshadow a lot of different things for an even greater conflict for part 3.

2024-08-06,Dune: Part Two,2024,https://boxd.it/72ilIt,5,Yes,"I re-watched Dune: Part Two on my home cinema, showing it to my wife, who hadn't seen it yet. I had a massive headache before starting the film and was scared that it would get worse by the loud film which this certaintly is. But after twenty minutes, I had forgotten about any pain and was quickly immersed into Dune. 

This time, I noticed the use of religion a lot more. Of course I noticed it the first time as well, but on a second watch knowing where it all goes, it was satisfying/scary to watch Jessica manipulate the Fremen and even her own son. Once Paul drinks the water of life, he also commits to being the messiah figure because he can see a narrow path through the future. But it's so, so narrow, and Paul has to be a great leader to pull it off. That's the biggest difference between the two films. Paul becomes a man, a leader, and a prophet. In the first part, he is reactive, doing only what his father tells him to do, but now he has come to his own, and he is the one leading. First by refusing to be used as a Bene Gesserit pawn, and then embracing it. For me, the most satisfying moment in the film, both films actually, is at the end when Paul uses his Voice on the old Reverend Mother to silence her. It's shows everybody that he is in control, and that the Bene Gesserit will have a hard time bending him to their will. The ways (honesty/manipulation) and tension (control/freedom) between Paul and the Bene Gesserit is masterfully heightened by Denis Villeneuve by editing and juxtaposing Paul's honest journey of becomming a Fremen, where he fightst for the freedom of the Fremen, with the meticulous schemings of the Bene Gesserit, who seek to control through manipulation. I thought this was done in a clever way, and it colides towards the end in nothing but a bittersweet ending, which makes me excited for the third and final part! 

As to whether this is a good adaptation of the book, I don't really know. I've only read the first part of the book, and I thought with a few exceptions, that it did a great job adapting the book to the silver screen! So, I guess it's the same for the second part... Anyways, I will read the rest of the book and then compare for a second re-watch probably, right before the third part is released.",,2024-08-03
2025-01-02,Anora,2024,https://boxd.it/8h9wF1,2,,"A bit funny, well-acted... and that's about it. We wanted to turn it off after half an hour, tired of the endless sex scenes and meaningless hedonism on display. I argued there might be a good payoff to all of this, so we kept watching.

When the ""grown-ups"" are on their way to care of things, a looming threat grows and I was intrigued by what might happen next. But instead of ramping up the suspense and stakes, the story shifted to babysitting a loudmouth Ani and an endless, tiring hunt for the rich kid. This part is loud and stressful, but not in a compelling way like Uncut Gems or Good Time — just noisy and pushing the audience's patience.

And what are we left with, aside from the obvious class commentary? ""Don't marry a rich kid in Vegas,"" and ""Igor is an okay guy""? A movie like this needs to justify how annoying it is with a big emotional payoff or at least something meaningful at the end. Instead, watching people clean up the mess caused by a rich kid wasn’t exactly thrilling.

It's a competent made movie with some good scenes, but it's just not enough... I wouldn’t recommend Anora. For something similar but far better, I’d suggest Uncut Gems, Good Time, or if you would like something from the same director that's actually meaningful, go watch The Florida Project.

2025-01-03,The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,2024,https://boxd.it/8hU8B9,1,,"Terrible. Recycled plot, characters, and lines straight from the original trilogy, but without the proper context. The music, except for the original score, is bland and generic. And don’t get me started on how that oliphant died… ridiculous. Just awful.

It has a simplistic and unrealistic plot, a stubborn, uninteresting villain, an over-the-top king who banishes and shouts and punches everyone, and a main character who’s basically an inferior version of Eowyn. And to top it off there’s the a terrible narration running throughout the whole film.

Anyway, I might have forgiven many of its flaws if the animation were amazing. It was not. In fact, it’s some of the worst animation I’ve seen in a while—janky, stiff characters, poor lip sync, and a lot of weird camera movements. I was either shaking my head, nodding off to sleep, or laughing at all the wrong moments. I had low expectations, but somehow not low enough. You could honestly skip this one.",,2025-01-03
2025-04-22,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,2022,https://boxd.it/9tIYTL,4,Yes,"Great animation and one of the best villain introductions in any movie! The exploration of mental health is surprisingly deep and doesn’t feel tacked on like it often does in other movies and shows. Puss experiences anxiety attacks and an identity crisis, going through a kind of mental clean-up that’s satisfying without the heaviness of a conventional drama. Ridiculously fun with real heart. A big recommendation from me!",,2025-04-21
