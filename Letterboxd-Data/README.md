# Letterboxd Data

This folder contains my exported Letterboxd data used for analysis in this project.

If you want to run the analysis with your own data:

1. Export your Letterboxd data from: https://letterboxd.com/settings/data/
2. Replace these CSV files with your own
3. Run the import script to rebuild the database

> Note: This data only includes my personal film watch history. No private user data is included.
